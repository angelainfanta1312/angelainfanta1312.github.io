        <p>It&rsquo;s long time that I wrote an Essay.<br>
I&rsquo;ll try my best with a poem to portray.<br>
Past were the days when my parents were fed up with their career<br>
And therefore with their advice I chose to be an engineer<br>
It&rsquo;s the story of my first year when<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know where to start,<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know how will I end,<br>
Maybe taking up Engineering was an Art<br>
And I &rsquo;ll pat myself and commend.<br>
Fast forwarding 4 years from then,<br>
I have made few friends whom I trust fully,<br>
I would like to thank few souls<br>
Who held their trust on me exponentially.<br>
They are my parents , Friends and the Almighty<br>
To whom each one of us are thankful for.<br>
At times when I crib about college, the frustration takes over me,<br>
I think about these people who are confident about me entirely.<br>
And as I&rsquo;m finishing my graduation from FCRIT,<br>
Now let me give my 2 cents on the friends I met sequentially.<br>
First I met Julie, a teachers&rsquo; daughter,<br>
Oh God we had relatable scenes to share,<br>
which had our laughter.<br>
When I ask you to worry about the projects, the skills we might require,<br>
I secretly wished to be as careless as you were.<br>
Thankyou Julie for being there  as my bench mate who asks me to meditate some or the other day,<br>
Moving on to next is Battina on the way.<br>
Your whatsapp status says, smile is the key that fits in the lock of everyone&rsquo;s&rsquo; heart,<br>
Damn thatâ€™s so true in my case, where I felt that I left my worries apart.<br>
I wish I had the pitch in your voice,<br>
I&rsquo;m glad to have you as a peer of my choice.<br>
Next I had a perspective that sudiksha might be a rude person,<br>
But I misunderstood her coercion.<br>
Seeing her reminds me of an alarm clock which would say:<br>
never bother when you arrive, but always be punctual to leave,<br>
You are never a people pleaser not giving a shit about what people perceive.<br>
Thank you for being my practical time bunker and bottle filler,<br>
Being with you is always a thriller.<br>
I next met Sherin and serena<br>
With whom I shared contacts the same day.<br>
Little did I know,<br>
That I would be sharing this poem one day.<br>
Initially I felt sherin to be skeptical of her thoughts<br>
That she never really shared what&rsquo;s in her mind,<br>
Maybe she found hard trusting people,<br>
Later then I found she is one of my kind.<br>
Thankyou sherin for giggling on almost all the life depressing talks we ever had.<br>
The lesson I learn  from you is when life throws lemons at you, have some jokes to share.<br>
What can I say about serena?<br>
I wish I had her brains, and maybe her physic, or her photography skill,<br>
I won&rsquo;t say she is lucky but works harder with all her will.<br>
Thank you Serena for being my inspiration,<br>
I pray that you see the fruits of your aspirations.<br>
Last but not the least it&rsquo;s about Riya that I wish to share,<br>
Always feeling others shoes, gives genuine love and care.<br>
Thank you for being a listener when I shared my lows,<br>
She has a lot of patience than what she shows.<br>
I sometimes wonder will there be any time when people are scared to approach you?<br>
But then I remember your angry face and that I and sherin got scared too.</p>
<p>With this I sum up my poem journeying through these few years,<br>
To each of you I&rsquo;ll be waving a goodbye holding my tears.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure we will be in Touch irrespective of the miles we are apart.<br>
So let&rsquo;s not worry about our lives having many moments of sorrow,<br>
Because the pain we feel today will be the strength we have tomorrow!</p>
