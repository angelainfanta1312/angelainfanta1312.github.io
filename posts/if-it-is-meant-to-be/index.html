        <p>2 years of hard work gave me unexpected results,<br>
No they weren&rsquo;t positive.<br>
I needed an exotic fruit, but those results gave me rotten smell,<br>
Disappointed me, thought it was unfair.<br>
Never was I ever so stressed,<br>
That I Felt every decision of mine went down the hill,<br>
When all I could hope for is to get some Will.<br>
Now after several months I realize,<br>
Maybe I was insane to choose a harder way,<br>
And that destiny wanted me to shift my lane.<br>
Now that I&rsquo;m Glad and Grateful for the silver lining I could see through,<br>
I thank all those souls who stood by me and have been through.<br>
Lot of lessons learned on how to stick to the &lsquo;D&rsquo;s<br>
And not If it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be!<br>
For me they are Discipline, Dedication and Devotion<br>
Henceforth never will I ever take any of them Granted,<br>
For now I know how I might get fainted.<br>
And by the end of the day,<br>
I Thank the Master above for all his Play!</p>
