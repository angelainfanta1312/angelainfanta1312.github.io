      <description>I fret about the past,
While impatient of my future,
And there is exhaustion at the present,
With many ongoing venture.
I wish I did this
Or am I doing it correct?
Or how will I do it?
Anyways, to drain is the answer.
Every capability in comparison with our potential,
unpolished with rusty characteristics
No one ever interested in a rat-race,
Yet many end up as statistics.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think this ever comes to an end,</description>

      <description>The thought of you brings tears sometimes
I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how one could invade.
the Tier 0 space in my heart.
Usually I can let go off any distraction,
Be it a crush or be it any soul,
And shift my focus at daily chore.
But recently I am proving it all wrong,
As I write this to be a poem or sing this to be a song
A thought which I&amp;rsquo;m trying to define,</description>

      <description>2 years of hard work gave me unexpected results,
No they weren&amp;rsquo;t positive.
I needed an exotic fruit, but those results gave me rotten smell,
Disappointed me, thought it was unfair.
Never was I ever so stressed,
That I Felt every decision of mine went down the hill,
When all I could hope for is to get some Will.
Now after several months I realize,
Maybe I was insane to choose a harder way,</description>

      <description>Happy Birthday to You…(2)
Happy Birthday dear Julie
Happy Birthday to You
During initial Engineering blues,
I hoped to get a good crew,
I had a glimpse when I met you,
That you&amp;rsquo;d be part of it too!
And now that we have walked through,
By the four different avenues,
I wish the best for you,
In your future endeavors too!
May Deloitte be great to you,
For your work life break through,</description>

      <title>Definition of Fun</title>

      <description>At an age group with Netflix binges, counterfeits and heartaches,
I found a pendant carrying dreams, failures and responsibility as a Load.
It preferred Late night Hustles, Many coffee cups and Limited breaks,
As its eyes stuck through many bugs in the Code.
&amp;ldquo;Bro why don’t you have some Fun?&amp;rdquo;
is the most frequent Question,
where Having no Regrets is all that she really wants -
Said One Direction.
Maybe the clubbers found it boring and a regret for missing out a moment,</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s long time that I wrote an Essay.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best with a poem to portray.
Past were the days when my parents were fed up with their career
And therefore with their advice I chose to be an engineer
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of my first year when
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know where to start,
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how will I end,
Maybe taking up Engineering was an Art
And I &amp;rsquo;ll pat myself and commend.</description>
