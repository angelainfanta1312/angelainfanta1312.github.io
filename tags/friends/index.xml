      <description>Happy Birthday to Youâ€¦(2)
Happy Birthday dear Julie
Happy Birthday to You
During initial Engineering blues,
I hoped to get a good crew,
I had a glimpse when I met you,
That you&amp;rsquo;d be part of it too!
And now that we have walked through,
By the four different avenues,
I wish the best for you,
In your future endeavors too!
May Deloitte be great to you,
For your work life break through,</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s long time that I wrote an Essay.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best with a poem to portray.
Past were the days when my parents were fed up with their career
And therefore with their advice I chose to be an engineer
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of my first year when
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know where to start,
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how will I end,
Maybe taking up Engineering was an Art
And I &amp;rsquo;ll pat myself and commend.</description>
